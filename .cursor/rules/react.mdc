# React / Client

## Components
- Use functional components. Use `forwardRef` + `useImperativeHandle` when the parent needs a ref/instance (e.g. CommonTable).
- Define props as an `interface` (e.g. `IProps`) and extend Ant Design types when needed: `TableProps<any> & IProps`.

## State and data
- Use `@tanstack/react-query` (useQuery, useMutation) for server state. Use the project’s `API_REQ_FUNCTION` type for request functions.
- Colocate component-only styles: `useStyle` hooks or co-located `.less`/`.css` next to the component.

## UI stack
- Ant Design (antd) for layout and components. Use `ConfigProvider`/theme when customizing.
- form-render with `Schema` for form/search schemas where used in the codebase.

## Exports
- Prefer `index.tsx` as the component entry; export the main component and any public types from there.
